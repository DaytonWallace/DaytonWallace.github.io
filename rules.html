    <h2> Rules <h2>
    <div>
      <p class="AlignCenter"> 
        No cheating or hacking. Whether you are hacking or not is decided by staff, and reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Staff require proof to ban people for more than 3 days. If you are caught, you will be permanently banned and Account banned as soon as possible. <br></br>
        
        No witch-hunting people. Do not overly target one person, and that single person alone. Factions are allowed, but only up to 3 people, as we do not have many slots currently. There are limits to everything in life. <br></br>
        
        Racism is absolutely not tolerated. You will be muted for 7 days at the sight of it, and if caught again, banned for 2 weeks, and if another time, banned permanently. <br></br>
        
        No spamming is allowed. Plain and simple. You will be muted if caught. <br></br>
        
        Advertisement is not allowed, legal action will be taken if caught. 
        
        SWAT/DDOS/DOXX/Server threats are also not tolerated. If you're caught that will be an immediate permanent ban. <br></br>
        
        Leaking other's personal information is not allowed. You will be muted, and/or banned depending on what/how much you leak. <br></br>
        
        Ban/Mute evading will earn you a permanent ban. <br></br>
