    Suclerious... a bot made from scratch in 100% JavaScript for now it was originaly called Mickey-Bot
    beacuse one of the creators me can make a pretty funny mickey voice which I cursed and screamed alot

    even more to this bot in the next update which will be posted on here what version we are in.
