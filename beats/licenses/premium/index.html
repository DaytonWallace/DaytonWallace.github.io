      <h2>12 - Warranties, Representations and Indemnification</h2>

      <p>
        Licensee hereby agrees that Licensor has not made any guarantees or promises that the
        Beat fits the particular creative use or musical purpose intended or desired by the Licensee.
        The Beat, its sound recording, and the underlying musical composition embodied therein,
        are licensed to the Licensee “as is” without warranties of any kind or fitness for a particular
        purpose.
        <br><br>Licensor warrants and represents that he has the full right and ability to enter into this
        agreement, and is not under any disability, restriction, or prohibition with respect to the grant
        of rights hereunder. Licensor warrants that the manufacture, sale, distribution, or other
        exploitation of the New Song hereunder will not infringe upon or violate any common law or
        statutory right of any person, firm, or corporation; including, without limitation, contractual
        rights, copyrights, and right(s) of privacy and publicity and will not constitute libel and/or
        slander.
        <br><br>Licensee warrants that the manufacture, sale, distribution, or other exploitation of the New
        Song hereunder will not infringe upon or violate any common law or statutory right of any
        person, firm, or corporation; including, without limitation, contractual rights, copyrights, and
        rights of privacy and publicity and will not constitute libel and/or slander. The foregoing

        Licensee. Licensee shall have no obligation to approve the use of any sample thereof;
        however, if approved, any payment in connection therewith, including any associated legal
        clearance costs, shall be borne by Licensee. Knowledge by Licensee that “samples” were
        used by Licensor which were not affirmatively disclosed by Licensor to Licensee shall shift,
        in whole or in part, the liability for infringement or violation of the rights of any third party
        arising from the use of any such “sample” from Licensor to Licensee.

        <br><br>Parties hereto shall indemnify and hold each other harmless from any and all third party
        claims, liabilities, costs, losses, damages or expenses as are actually incurred by the
        non-defaulting party and shall hold the non-defaulting party, free, safe, and harmless against
        and from any and all claims, suits, demands, costs, liabilities, loss, damages, judgments,
        recoveries, costs, and expenses; (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees),
        which may be made or brought, paid, or incurred by reason of any breach or claim of breach
        of the warranties and representations hereunder by the defaulting party, their agents, heirs,
        successors, assigns and employees, which have been reduced to final judgment; provided
        that prior to final judgment, arising out of any breach of any representations or warranties of
        the defaulting party contained in this agreement or any failure by defaulting party to perform
        any obligations on its part to be performed hereunder the non-defaulting party has given the
        defaulting party prompt written notice of all claims and the right to participate in the defense
        with counsel of its choice at its sole expense. In no event shall Licensee be entitled to seek
        injunctive or any other equitable relief for any breach or non-compliance with any provision
        of this agreement.
      </p>
